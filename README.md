# Mask Detection Using CNN model using Python

## Classification

This project is based on classification problem. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we present a robust deep learning pipeline that is capable of identifying correct and incorrect mask-wearing from real-time video streams.

## Dataset 

You are provided with following files :
1. with_mask : This folder contains 1900+ images of people wearing mask which we divide into train and test set in 80:20 ratio.

2. without_mask : This folder contains 1900+ images of people not wearing mask which we again divide into train and test set in 80:20 ratio.
